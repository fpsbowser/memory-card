# Old School Runescape Memory Game

Following theodinproject curriculum, this is the project I created for the Memory Card project. Since OSRS is one of my favorite games, I decided to make it OSRS themed.

Built with the React library using functional components and hooks.

## Languages Used

HTML/CSS/Javascript

React:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Bugs/Issues

Currently there are some issues with displaying the cards in all browsers but **Firefox**.
The game will still work correctly with any browser but **I recommend using Firefox to avoid weird visual bugs.**
